      The <b>postprocessing</b> parameter provides a means for the user to modify the
      service results before the completion of the service. It also allows the user to
      inspect previously saved information with <b>set_var</b> and compare to
      information retrieved by this service to make further decisions as to what actions
      should be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postprocessing mode selector above allows the user to select when the
      postprocessing will run: always, only on success, or only on failure. Note that
      the postprocessing runs before the validation and notification parts of the
      service.

      In the below example, card states are compared to ensure all cards are ready for
      an upgrade. By setting <b>results['success'] = False</b>, we can force the service
      to be re-executed using the <b>retries</b> and <b>time between retries</b> set in
      <b>Step 1</b>
    </p>

  <textarea class="help-snippet" style="height: fit-content;">
    upgrade_status_results = results['result']
    for card_name, card_values in upgrade_status_result.items():
      card_state = card_values['exa-base:status']['state']
      if card_state == "Reload required to finish activation":
        card_ready += 1

    if card_ready == len(upgrade_status_results):
      results["success"] = True
      results["result"] = 'All cards ready for reload'
    else:
      results['success'] = False
      results['result'] = 'Waiting for ready'
