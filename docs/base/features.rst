Features

Creation of the network
-----------------------

Your network topology can be created manually or imported from an
external Source of Truth (OpenNMS, LibreNMS, or Netbox).
Once created, it is displayed in a sortable and searchable table.
A dashboard provides a graphical overview of your network with dynamic charts.

Network visualization
---------------------

eNMS can display your network on a world map (Google Map or Open Street Map).
Each device is displayed at its GPS coordinates.
You can click on a device to display its properties, configuration, or start an SSH terminal session.

Colocated devices can be grouped into geographical sites (campus, datacenter, ...),
and displayed logically with a force-directed layout.

Workflows
---------

Services can be combined into a workflow.
When a workflow is executed, its status is updated in real-time on the web UI.

Configuration Management
------------------------

eNMS can work as a network device configuration backup tool and replace
Oxidized/Rancid with the following features:

  - Poll network elements and store the latest configuration in the database.
  - Search for any text or regular-expression in all configurations.
  - Download device configuration to a local text file.
  - Use the REST API support to return a specified deviceâ€™s configuration.
  - Export all configurations to a remote Git repository (e.g. Gitlab)
  - View git-style differences between various revisions of a configuration

Event-driven automation
-----------------------

While services can be run directly and immediately from the UI, you can also schedule them to run at a later time,
or periodically by defining a frequency or a CRON expression. All scheduled tasks are displayed in a calendar.

Services can also be executed programmatically:

  - eNMS has a REST API and a CLI interface that can be used to create, update and delete any type of objects,
    but also to trigger the execution of a service.
  - eNMS can be configured as a Syslog server, and rules can be created for syslog messages
    to trigger the execution of a service.
