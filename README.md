# Introduction

eNMS is a vendor-agnostic NMS designed for building workflow-based network automation solutions.

[![eNMS](docs/_static/enms.png)](http://afourmy.pythonanywhere.com/views/geographical_view)

It encompasses the following aspects of network automation:
  - **Configuration Management Service**: Backup with Git, change and rollback of configurations.
  - **Validation Services**: Validate data about the state of a device with Netmiko and NAPALM.
  - **Ansible Service**: Store and run Ansible playbooks.
  - **REST Service**: Send REST calls with variable URL and payload.
  - **Python Script Service**: Any python script can be integrated into the web UI. eNMS will automatically generate
a form in the UI for the script input parameters.
  - **Workflows**: Services can be combined together graphically in a workflow.
  - **Scheduling**: Services and workflows can be scheduled to start at a later time, or run periodically with CRON.
  - **Event-driven automation**: Services and workflows can be triggered by an external event (REST call, Syslog message, etc).

# Main features

## 1. Network creation

Your network topology can be created manually or imported from an
external Source of Truth (OpenNMS, LibreNMS, or Netbox).
Once created, it is displayed in a sortable and searchable table.
A dashboard provides a graphical overview of your network with dynamic charts.

Inventory                           |  Dashboard
:----------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:

- Docs: _[Objects](https://enms.readthedocs.io/en/develop/inventory/network_creation.html)_

## 2. Network visualization

eNMS can display your network on a world map (Google Map or Open Street Map).
Each device is displayed at its GPS coordinates.
You can click on a device to display its properties, configuration, or start an SSH terminal session.
Colocated devices can be grouped into geographical sites (campus, dacacenter, ...),
and displayed logically with a force-directed layout.

- Docs: _[Geographical View](https://enms.readthedocs.io/en/develop/inventory/network_visualization.html)_

## 3. Service creation

eNMS comes with a number of "default services" leveraging libraries such as `ansible`, `requests`, `netmiko`, `napalm`  to perform simple automation tasks. However, absolutely any python script can be turned into a service. If your python script takes input parameters, eNMS will automatically generate a form in the web UI.

Services can be combined into a workflow.

[![Workflow Builder](docs/_static/base/workflow.png)](https://enms.readthedocs.io/en/develop/automation/workflows.html)

- Docs: _[Workflow System](https://enms.readthedocs.io/en/develop/automation/workflows.html)_, _[Workflow Payload](https://enms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows/workflow_payload.html)_

## 5. Configuration Management

eNMS can be used as a device configuration backup tool, like Oxidized/Rancid, with the following features:

  - Poll network devices and store the latest configuration in the database
  - Store any operational data that can be retrieved from the device CLI (e.g ``show version``, ``get facts`` etc.)
  - Search for any text or regular-expression in all configurations
  - Download device configuration to a local text file
  - Use the REST API support to return a specified deviceâ€™s configuration
  - Export all configurations to a remote Git repository (e.g. Gitlab)
  - View git-style differences between various revisions of a configuration

Search Configuration                          |  Compare Configuration
:--------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------:
[![Search](docs/_static/base/configuration_search.png)](https://enms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/configuration_management.html) |  [![History](docs/_static/base/configuration_history.png)](https://enms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/configuration_management.html)

## 6. Event-driven automation

While services can be run directly and immediately from the UI, you can also schedule them to run at a later time, or periodically by defining a frequency or a CRON expression. All scheduled tasks are displayed in a calendar.

[![Calendar](docs/_static/base/calendar.png)](https://enms.readthedocs.io/en/develop/automation/execution.html)

Services can also be executed programmatically:
  - eNMS has a REST API and a CLI interface that can be used to create, update and delete any type of objects,
    but also to trigger the execution of a service.
  - eNMS can be configured as a Syslog server, and rules can be created for syslog messages
    to trigger the execution of a service.
